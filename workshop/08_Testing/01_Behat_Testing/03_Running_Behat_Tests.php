//    Now we're ready to run our Behat tests:
//    - right click a "basket.feature" file > select "Create basket.feature" with a "B" (for Behat) logo against it.
//
//        IDE would fill out all the necessary settings for us.
//        In case you want to fine tune those settings - feel free to either edit automatically created configuration
//        or create a Behat run configuration anew using Run > Edit Configurations > "+" sign > Behat. See more
//        about available options at https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/run-debug-configuration-behat.html
//
//    Let's stick to default for now. Click "Ok" and a "Run" tool window would appear with test results!
//
//    You should receive a result similar to the one below:
//
//            1 scenario (1 passed)
//            4 steps (4 passed)
//            0m0.04s (7.97Mb)
//
//            Process finished with exit code 0
//
//    You can verify this running `vendor\bin\behat` in terminal.
