// To start using Behat in your project you can call behat with the `--init` option inside your project directory.
//    We would probably require Behat executable for that. Let's go ahead and install Behat via composer:
//    add lines below to your composer.json and run an Install/Update. We're adding phpunit installation here to assist us further. Why those versions exactly? Just to keep consistency in a project.
//
//    "require": {
//        "behat/behat": "v3.4.1",
//        "phpunit/phpunit": "5.2.5"
//    }
//
//
//    Once this is installed let's proceed with Behat init. To do this open Terminal and run
//    `vendor\bin\behat --init` (or `vendor/bin/behat --init` depending on your OS).
//
//    Notice the newly created `/features/` folder in a project root. This is where we will store our "features".
